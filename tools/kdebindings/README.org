#+TITLE: Kdebindings

The code under this directory was originally imported from the
[[https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kdebindings][kdebindings]] project. We embedded =kdebindings= within =qtbase= to ease
distribution by minimizing external system dependencies. There were
some initial changes to the build configuration so that it would build
inside of =qtbase=. Since then, all changes have been recorded in the
git history. As of yet, none of the changes have been appropriate for
pushing upstream.

Soon after the import, the =kdebindings= project reorganized its code
base and changed how the bindings are configured. The new layout was
not very convenient for our design, so we diverged. Thus, we now need
to maintain the build scripts, XML configuration files, etc. It
remains fairly easy to port upstream improvements to the Smoke
generator, and we try to synchronize occasionally.
